change this data testing to also clean (i.e. delete rows that dont pass the tests) # test data from Spotify data <- read_rds(here::here("data/the_national.rds")) # test for missing values in the dataset any(is.na(data)) # test whether variables of interest are doubles is.double(data$album_release_year) is.double(data$danceability) is.double(data$energy) is.double(data$instrumentalness) is.double(data$valence)

To modify your data testing code so that it cleans the data by removing rows that don't pass the tests, you can use filter() from the dplyr package to remove rows with NA values and ensure that specific columns are numeric. Here's how you can adjust your code:
r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
data <- read_rds(here::here("data/the_national.rds"))

# Remove rows with missing values
data <- data %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.))  # Keeps only rows with no missing values

# Ensure that variables of interest are doubles, removing rows if not
data <- data %>%
  filter(is.double(album_release_year),
         is.double(danceability),
         is.double(energy),
         is.double(instrumentalness),
         is.double(valence))

# Check if the dataset is now clean
any(is.na(data))  # Should return FALSE if all NAs are removed

# Check the structure of the cleaned data to ensure the desired columns are doubles
str(data)

In this updated code:
The complete.cases() function ensures that all rows with any missing values are removed.
The filter() function checks that the columns of interest are doubles, and only keeps rows that satisfy these conditions.

You can save the cleaned data back to the .rds file using saveRDS() after performing the cleaning operations. Here's the full updated script including saving the cleaned dataset back to the same file:
r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
data <- read_rds(here::here("data/the_national.rds"))

# Remove rows with missing values
data <- data %>%
  filter(complete.cases(.))  # Keeps only rows with no missing values

# Ensure that variables of interest are doubles, removing rows if not
data <- data %>%
  filter(is.double(album_release_year),
         is.double(danceability),
         is.double(energy),
         is.double(instrumentalness),
         is.double(valence))

# Save the cleaned data back to the .rds file
saveRDS(data, here::here("data/the_national.rds"))

# Confirm the file has been updated by loading it again (optional)
updated_data <- read_rds(here::here("data/the_national.rds"))
str(updated_data)

This will overwrite the existing .rds file with the cleaned data. The final step is optional but verifies that the cleaned data is successfully saved.

I have a dataset with variables: album_release_year, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, and valence. I want to make plots in R using GGplot, which shows the relationship of each of the 4 variables over album_release_year. I want each plot to have points for each data point and a line of the yearly averages.

Thought for 6 seconds
To visualize the relationships between each of the four variables (danceability, energy, instrumentalness, and valence) and album_release_year in your dataset using ggplot2 in R, you can follow these steps:
Install and Load Necessary Libraries
Prepare Your Data (Optional)
Create Individual Plots
Create a Faceted Plot (Optional)
Below, I provide detailed instructions and code snippets for each method.

1. Install and Load Necessary Libraries
First, ensure you have the necessary packages installed and loaded. We'll use ggplot2 for plotting, dplyr for data manipulation, and tidyr for reshaping data (if needed).
R
Copy code
# Install packages if you haven't already
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))

# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)


2. Prepare Your Data (Optional)
Assuming your data is in a data frame named df with the following columns:
album_release_year
danceability
energy
instrumentalness
valence
Here's a quick example of what your data might look like:
R
Copy code
# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(
  album_release_year = rep(2000:2020, each = 10),
  danceability = runif(210, 0, 1),
  energy = runif(210, 0, 1),
  instrumentalness = runif(210, 0, 1),
  valence = runif(210, 0, 1)
)

Ensure your actual dataset is loaded correctly into the df data frame.

3. Create Individual Plots for Each Variable
You can create separate plots for each variable to visualize their relationship with album_release_year. Each plot will display individual data points and a line representing the yearly average.
a. Danceability Plot
R
Copy code
ggplot(df, aes(x = album_release_year, y = danceability)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "darkgreen") +  # Individual data points
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line", color = "blue", size = 1.2) +  # Yearly average line
  labs(
    title = "Danceability Over Album Release Year",
    x = "Album Release Year",
    y = "Danceability"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

b. Energy Plot
R
Copy code
ggplot(df, aes(x = album_release_year, y = energy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "darkred") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line", color = "blue", size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Energy Over Album Release Year",
    x = "Album Release Year",
    y = "Energy"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

c. Instrumentalness Plot
R
Copy code
ggplot(df, aes(x = album_release_year, y = instrumentalness)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "purple") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line", color = "blue", size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Instrumentalness Over Album Release Year",
    x = "Album Release Year",
    y = "Instrumentalness"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

d. Valence Plot
R
Copy code
ggplot(df, aes(x = album_release_year, y = valence)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "orange") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line", color = "blue", size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Valence Over Album Release Year",
    x = "Album Release Year",
    y = "Valence"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

You can customize colors, themes, and other aesthetics as desired.
